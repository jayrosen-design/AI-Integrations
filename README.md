**Presenter Notes:**
I am Jay Rosen, a Programmer at ETC, working with Augmented and Virtual Reality game development for New Worlds Reading and Institute Advanced Learning such as the VERSE project with Dr. Nigel Newbutt.
Before I joined UF, in 2020, I was the founder of an Al startup, Space Age Mining Corporation here in Gainesville, building an Al datacenter from the ground up, and working with gaming and film companies in Los Angeles on procedural generated projects, and during this time was an early beta tester for OpenAl, testing the original Dall-E, and early Codex, which would later become known as ChatGPT.
Since joining UF, I have had the opportunity to continue professional development, completing several Al certificate programs at Vanderbilt University and the Nvidia Deep Learning Institute, and even winning awards at hackathons from Nasa and the VR/AR Association for developing Al prototypes.
I'm going to share some of the tricks I've learned in prompt engineering and some useful Al applications I've been working with lately.

**Presenter Notes:**
After a year of working at UF in the IT department, I showcased some of my personal Al projects that I had been working on at the time, created using tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney. I use Al for different types of projects, from application development, art creation, 3D prototyping, computer vision, and use Al to help aid my astrophotography telescoping hobby, which helped identify and discover a newly formed supernova in my photo of whirlpool galaxy

**Presenter Notes:**
This past week, at the Al Summit in Orlando, I shared how I'm Developing with Al & Augmented Reality for the Classroom in building New Worlds Reading AR Expeditions, which is an educational video game designed to enhance literacy in 3rd- to 5th-grade students through interactive, immersive AR experiences.
By integrating Al tools at every stage of development-from brainstorming and concept art to programming and gameplay-we demonstrate the transformative potential of Al-driven design in educational technologies. Al-enhanced tools powered the rapid generation of creative ideas, streamlined art and music asset creation, automated game scripting, and provided multilingual voiceovers and translations to reach diverse student audiences.

![Slide 10](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AI-Integrations/blob/main/slides/AI%20Integrations%20-%20Jay%20Rosen%20-%20February%2027_Page_10.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
Although Navigator Chat is a more secure chatbot environment that is hosted by UF, The Data Policies for Navigator chat approve the use with OPEN DATA only. Navigator chat is not yet approved to use Sensitive or Restricted Data. This policy also applies to using non-UF Al chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, so please do not use any Sensitive or Restricted data with Al tools.
Although unpublished research data is listed as sensitive, Navigator and the LLMS can absolutely help you with your research.

### Slide 11
![Slide 11](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AI-Integrations/blob/main/slides/AI%20Integrations%20-%20Jay%20Rosen%20-%20February%2027_Page_11.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
Here I'm logged into Navigator Chat. To select the Al model, there is a dropdown at the top, and also on the right sidebar if you have that open. You can search by name or scroll the through the list.

---
### Slide 12
![Slide 12](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AI-Integrations/blob/main/slides/AI%20Integrations%20-%20Jay%20Rosen%20-%20February%2027_Page_12.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
These are the current LLMS hosted on Navigator, including open source models running on HiPerGator, the OpenAl chatgpt and Dall-e Image Generator running on Microsoft Azure, the Google Gemini models, and the AWS Claude models. Each LLM does have different characteristics since they are trained on different data sets, so I will try to go over some of the more useful LLMs of the bunch.
At this time, these LLMs do not search online, compared to if you purchased the premium model of like Gemini or ChatGPT - however, that feature might come in a future update.

---
### Slide 13
![Slide 13](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AI-Integrations/blob/main/slides/AI%20Integrations%20-%20Jay%20Rosen%20-%20February%2027_Page_13.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
So with all these Al models - which Al is best?
Its a difficult answer, since each Al is trained on different data.
You can take a look at the Chatbot Arena LLM Leaderboard, which is crowd-sourced Al benchmarking for each of the models in tasks such as writing, math, coding, creative writing, and more criteria.
The AI LLM landscape is constantly changing, just this past month, all of the top 10 models have been completely re-arranged with new releases.

### Slide 14
![Slide 14](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AI-Integrations/blob/main/slides/AI%20Integrations%20-%20Jay%20Rosen%20-%20February%2027_Page_14.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
Prompt to Leaderboard is another way to analyze which AI Model performs specifically well at a type of category. Each of these categories and topics can be drilled down further, where you do see certain AI models perform better or worse - which could help you if you choose the right AI model for the type of tasks or research you want to complete.

### Slide 15
![Slide 15](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AI-Integrations/blob/main/slides/AI%20Integrations%20-%20Jay%20Rosen%20-%20February%2027_Page_15.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
This table provides a comparison of various Al language models based on their training data cutoff, context window size, maximum output length, and token pricing.
The Training Data Cutoff indicates how current the knowledge is, so if you try to ask it questions relating to an event after 2024, it might not be able to provide an accurate response.
Context window or tokens is the maximum number of tokens or words the model can process at once, affecting how much information it can consider in a single prompt. This is essentially the amount of memory that the AI can hold with the context of the single conversation. If you have ever used a chatbot, and had a long conversation where you had trained it on documents, and it was responding great to a point where it seems to have forgotten the basic info - its because it has gone past its maximum context window. The models with the highest Context window is Gemini 1.5 pro with 2 million tokens, and Gemini 1.5 flash with 1 million tokens. The newer ChatGPT O3 mini and Claude Sonnet are about double the context window compared to the other models.
The Max Output length is the longest possible response the model can generate in a single output. This is great if you need a fully articulated long response - which you can get with the ChatGPT o3-mini, of about 100,000 tokens which is roughly 200-300 pages of a book or about 2,000 lines of code for a python program. Compared to the 16,000 tokens output of GPT 40 which is about 40 page book or just 300 lines of code.
For pricing, you can also see the cost efficiency of these different models, so using GPT 4o will cost about $5 for ever 1 million tokens of input as training, and cost $15 for ever 1 million tokens generated.
Since the university is covering the cost of these models,
For Largest context window and deep research - use Gemini 1.5 pro or Claude 3.5 sonnet
For balance of speed, reasoning, and accuracy - use GPT 4o
For working with code, large datasets, or long documents - use o3-mini or the o1-mini

### Slide 27
![Slide 27](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AI-Integrations/blob/main/slides/AI%20Integrations%20-%20Jay%20Rosen%20-%20February%2027_Page_27.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
This is an illustration that was shared by Dr. Jules White, a professor of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University which shows the progress of developing a more efficient prompt.
For example, when you first started using a chatbot, you asked a simple prompt - such as Tell me XYZ about company X - this is a short prompt with no context, and risks hallucinations.
A better prompt asking the same question is to provide context like, including documents uploaded or copied and pasted information - this lowers the hallucination risk.
Even better AI response, is to guide the AI in how you want the response to be crafted with a fact-checkable references, by giving it clear instructions such as Tell me XYZ about company X using attached documents. Quote from the documents in the format insert quote and page number.
Even better is to use the AI to engage your own thinking by providing multiple perspectives. This will cause the AI to have to think longer before outputting as it is is now requested to provide a quote and page number to support 3 different perspectives about a topic.

### Slide 28
![Slide 28](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AI-Integrations/blob/main/slides/AI%20Integrations%20-%20Jay%20Rosen%20-%20February%2027_Page_28.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
Dr. Jules White is the instructor of Prompt Eningeering courses from Vanderbilt that is available on Coursera. There are multiple specializations on these topics of utilizing the AI tools for different disciplines such as Educators, Project Managers, and Leaders. The course goes over different prompt engineering techniques and ways to tackle a problem using tool like Chat GPT or its more advanced features like Data Analysis or Vision capability.
There are also similar Prompt Engineering courses on Coursera provided by Google, AWS, IBM, and University of Michigan.

### Slide 29
![Slide 29](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AI-Integrations/blob/main/slides/AI%20Integrations%20-%20Jay%20Rosen%20-%20February%2027_Page_29.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
The Question Refinement Pattern helps you make a better prompt, by asking the chatbot to improve your questions. This helps create more focused questions that can lead to more useful and relevant responses, highlighting missing context.
To best use this, and most of the prompt patterns, You will create a root prompt - which is the first message you use to start the conversation, which will be used throughout the conversation
For example- start by saying From now on, whenever I ask a question, suggest a better version of the question to use instead.
So here I set the root prompt, and ask it Should I attend UF? And it responds with an improved question, considering academic goals, financial situation, career aspirations, and also suggestions comparison to other options.
Another question refined - As a university administrator or professor, how do I prepare for aI taking over jobs?
The refined prompt is - How can University administrators and professors adapt their roles and responsibilities to effectively leverage AI while ensuring the continued relevance and value of higher education in a rapidly evolving technological landscape?

### Slide 30
![Slide 30](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AI-Integrations/blob/main/slides/AI%20Integrations%20-%20Jay%20Rosen%20-%20February%2027_Page_30.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
So when you use the question that is suggested- instead of refining, it will answer with more detail
So it suggests to
Embrace for AI efficiency - use AI taks to reduce burden and help with automating tasks
Invest in AI literacy training - such has this workshop
Reimagine Curricum Design
Develop New programs and courses
Foster collaboration
And for each of these suggestions - you can continue to ask it to elaborate and continue to discuss and build out the ideas.

**Presenter Notes:**
One of the patterns that really helped me understand how AI can be used more effectively is the Persona Pattern, which instructs the AI to act like a specific role or character which would give a more specific response.
This can make the AI answers more relevant and authentic to a given scenario.
To use it, you use the pattern
Act as Persona X and Perform Task Y.
On the right are some example persona patterns from a github repo
I want you to act as an educational content creator. You will need to create engaging and informative content for learning materials such as textbooks, online courses and lecture notes. My first suggestion request is "I need help developing a lesson plan on renewable energy sources for high school students."

**Presenter Notes:**
AI For Work is a Prompt Generating website that can help you to help you find a persona, and provides you with starter prompts to help you complete your task or think about how AI can be used in your field.
From the AI for Work homepage, we see a bunch of different careers. I'm going to select Education.

**Presenter Notes:**
Under Professor, we now see simple prompt starters that give us idea of how we can use AI to accomplish a task such as Creating a Grant Proposal or creating a conference Abstract Document.

---
### Slide 35
![Slide 35](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AI-Integrations/blob/main/slides/AI%20Integrations%20-%20Jay%20Rosen%20-%20February%2027_Page_35.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
When you select one of the starter prompts, you will see a much larger prompt that you can copy and paste into the Navigator or ChatGPT.

---
### Slide 36
![Slide 36](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AI-Integrations/blob/main/slides/AI%20Integrations%20-%20Jay%20Rosen%20-%20February%2027_Page_36.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
So here I am back in Navigator, and I pasted the prompt. You will notice that the Navigator understand the pre-written prompt and introduces itself as the expert professor at grant writing. It then gives you list of 5 questions to fill out to gather more context and understanding about your specific request - such as what is the specific research area for the grant proposal, which funding agencies are you targeting, what is the estimated budget, what are the key innovative aspects of the research and potential impact, and do you have any preliminary data or publications to support the feasibility.
As you provide additional context for the AI for work bot, it is programmed to ask more questions to refine its output, even using a rubric to grade its own output to improve the outcome.
So even if you can't come up with an advanced prompt yourself, you can easily copy and paste one of the AI for Work prompts to get you started and have the AI help guide you in providing the context for it to work more effectively.
